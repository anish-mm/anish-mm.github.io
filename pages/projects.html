                            I worked on Drupal 8, a free and open-source Content Management Framework distributed under the GNU General Public License. I analyzed the software’s code, structure and working, brought out an article introducing Drupal’s workflow and made a presentation on its render pipeline to the staff at Zyxware Technologies. I also made contributions in the form of patches to Drupal’s existing modules.

                        <p>
                            Zyxware is the best place to go to for learning Drupal because it is the leading contributor to Drupal from India, a featured service providers on drupal.org and a Drupal Association Organisation Member.

                            The project was intended to familiarize us with team project management and different software design strategies. We created a Command Line Interface form of the famous game. We used C++ and followed the Object-oriented paradigm.
