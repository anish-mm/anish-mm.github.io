            <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>

            <p>I am a Computer Science Engineer in the making, a movie buff, an avid reader, animal lover (esp. dogs &hearts;), math enthusiast, maybe a nerd, and much more. I wish to travel the world (after all, 20 years is more than enough time spent in one place) and explore her wonders. I am intrigued by people, culture, and mindsets. I like listening to others and enjoy conversations about culture and religion, and often annoy people with questions on these topics. </p>

            <p>Over the last two years spent at IIT, it has given me a lot of invaluable experiences. The first week of college was a huge culture shock for me (and I guess for everyone) having been thrown into a mix of people from all over India. Mingling with this crowd required a lot of attention to detail; apparently, when you mix languages, it can lead to hilarious outcomes! The vibrant mix of culture piqued my curiosity and it proved to me that I really enjoy these intricacies. A lot has happened since then and I find myself keeping active contacts with people halfway across the country!</p>

            <p>It goes without saying that in IIT you spend a lot of time racking your brain trying to wrap your head around that one concept that the professor explained in class. It sort of comes with the territory. Be that as it may, I try to keep a check on it. I take caution to see that my academics don't eat into my other interests and vice versa (unless of course, they overlap!).</p>

            <p>I have always wanted to go for higher studies but didn't know which field to pursue. I was always interested in Mathematics (I still am!) but I didn't know which domain of Mathematics interested me the most or whether it was pure math that I wanted to go further in. For the past few years I have been trying to find an answer to this question, and guess what! I think I found it. In college, I got introduced to the field of Machine Learning and this is it. I find it to be fascinating, challenging and satisfying; and THAT, my friend, is the recipe for addiction.</p>

            <p>In my free time, I try to take up some projects of my own. Currently, I am learning to use the p5.js library to make interactive graphics and I am checking out static site-building. I am trying out Machine Learning lectures on the web to supplement my knowledge. Apart from these, I am also working on some team projects.</p>
