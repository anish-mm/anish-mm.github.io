<p>I am from Ernakulam, Kerala, India. I am currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Palakkad, Kerala.</p>
<p>I have always wanted to go for higher studies but hadn't the faintest idea as to which field to pursue. I was always interested in Mathematics (and I still am!) but I didn't know which domain of mathematics interested me the most or whether it was in pure math that I wanted to go further in. In college, I have been trying to answer this question. Here, I got introduced to the field of Machine Learning and I felt the same fascination that I felt for math. in my school days. I am now quite sure that this is the field I want to do my higher studies in. </p>
<p>In my free time (which is not too much in this semseter :(), I am trying to follow lectures on chaos theory.</p>
